I am a fourth-year CS PhD Candidate at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the [Computational Robotics Research Group](https://robotics.cs.unc.edu) advised by [Professor Ron Alterovitz](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~ron/). My research focus is robotics, specifically motion planning and medical robotics. I am interested in applying methods in reinforcement learning and computer vision to solve robotics problems.

<!-- I obtained a B.S. in Artificial Intelligence from Carnegie Mellon University. I am a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve, where I serve as an Executive Officer for Charlie Company, 345th Military Intelligence Battalion. -->
